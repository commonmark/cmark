  * Switch to 2-clause BSD license, with agreement of contributors.
  * Added Profile build type, `make prof` target.
  * Fixed autolink scanner to conform to the spec. Backslash escapes
    not allowed in autolinks.
  * Don't rely on strnlen being available (Nick Wellnhofer).
  * Updated scanners for new whitespace definition.
  * Added `CMARK_OPT_SMART` and `--smart` option, `smart.c`, `smart.h`.
  * Added test for `--smart` option.
  * Fixed segfault with --normalize (closes #7).
  * Moved normalization step from XML renderer to `cmark_parser_finish`.
  * Added options parameter to `cmark_parse_document`, `cmark_parse_file`.
  * Fixed man renderer's escaping for unicode characters.
  * Don't require python3 to make `cmark.3` man page.
  * Use ASCII escapes for punctuation characters for portability.
  * Made `options` an int rather than a long, for consistency.
  * Packed `cmark_node` struct to fit into 128 bytes.
    This gives a small performance boost and lowers memory usage.
  * Repacked `delimiter` struct to avoid hole.
  * Fixed use-after-free bug, which arose when a paragraph containing
    only reference links and blank space was finalized (#9).
    Avoid using `parser->current` in the loop that creates new
    blocks, since `finalize` in `add_child` may have removed
    the current parser (if it contains only reference definitions).
    This isn't a great solution; in the long run we need to rewrite
    to make the logic clearer and to make it harder to make
    mistakes like this one.
  * Added 'Asan' build type. `make asan` will link against ASan; the
    resulting executable will do checks for memory access issues.
    Thanks @JordanMilne for the suggestion.
  * Add Makefile target to fuzz with AFL (Nick Wellnhofer)
    The variable `$AFL_PATH` must point to the directory containing the AFL
    binaries. It can be set as an environment variable or passed to make on
    the command line.

  * Stripped out all JavaScript related code and documentation, moving
    it to a separate repository (<https://github.com/jgm/commonmark.js>).
  * Improved Makefile targets, so that `cmake` is run again only when
    necessary (Nick Wellnhofer).
  * Added `INSTALL_PREFIX` to the Makefile, allowing installation to a
    location other than `/usr/local` without invoking `cmake`
    manually (Nick Wellnhofer).
  * `make test` now guarantees that the project will
    be rebuilt before tests are run (Nick Wellnhofer).
  * Prohibited overriding of some Makefile variables (Nick Wellnhofer).
  * Provide version number and string, both as macros
    (`CMARK_VERSION`, `CMARK_VERSION_STRING`) and as symbols
    (`cmark_version`, `cmark_version_string`) (Nick Wellnhofer).  All of
    these come from `cmark_version.h`, which is constructed from a
    template `cmark_version.h.in` and data in `CMakeLists.txt`.
  * Avoid calling `free` on null pointer.
  * Added an accessor for an iterator's root node (`cmark_iter_get_root`).
  * Added user data field for nodes (Nick Wellnhofer).  This is
    intended mainly for use in bindings for dynamic languages, where
    it could store a pointer to a target language object (#287).  But
    it can be used for anything.
  * Man renderer:  properly escape multiline strings.
  * Added assertion to raise error if finalize is called on a closed block.
  * Implemented the new spec rule for emphasis and strong emphasis with `_`.
  * Moved the check for fence-close with the other checks for end-of-block.
  * Fixed a bug with loose list detection with items containings
    fenced code blocks (#285).
  * Removed recursive algorithm in `ends_with_blank_line` (#286).
  * Minor code reformatting: renamed parameters.

[0.16]

  * Added xml renderer (XML representation of the CommonMark AST,
    which is described in `CommonMark.dtd`).
  * Reduced size of gperf entity table (Nick Wellnhofer).
  * Reworked iterators to allow deletion of nodes during iteration
    (Nick Wellnhofer).
  * Optimized `S_is_leaf`.
  * Added `cmark_iter_reset` to iterator API.
  * Added `cmark_consolidate_text_nodes` to API to combine adjacent
    text nodes.
  * Added `CMARK_OPT_NORMALIZE` to options (this combines adjacent
    text nodes).
  * Added `--normalize` option to command-line program.
  * Improved regex for HTML comments in inline parsing.
  * Python is no longer required for a basic build from the
    repository.
