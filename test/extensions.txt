## Tables

Here's a well-formed table, doing everything it should.

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
| ghi | jkl |
| mno | pqr |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> abc </th>
<th> def </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> ghi </td>
<td> jkl </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> mno </td>
<td> pqr </td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````

We're going to mix up the table now; we'll demonstrate that inline formatting
works fine, but block elements don't.  You can also have empty cells, and the
textual alignment of the columns is shown to be irrelevant.

```````````````````````````````` example
Hello!

| _abc_ | セン |
| ----- | ---- |
| 1. Block elements inside cells don't work. | |
| But **_inline elements do_**. | x |

Hi!
.
<p>Hello!</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> <em>abc</em> </th>
<th> セン </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 1. Block elements inside cells don't work. </td>
<td> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> But <strong><em>inline elements do</em></strong>. </td>
<td> x </td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>Hi!</p>
````````````````````````````````

Here we demonstrate some edge cases about what is and isn't a table.

```````````````````````````````` example
| Not enough table | to be considered table |

| Not enough table | to be considered table |
| Not enough table | to be considered table |

| Just enough table | to be considered table |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |

| ---- | --- |

|x|
|-|

| xyz |
| --- |
.
<p>| Not enough table | to be considered table |</p>
<p>| Not enough table | to be considered table |
| Not enough table | to be considered table |</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Just enough table </th>
<th> to be considered table </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody></tbody></table>
<p>| ---- | --- |</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>x</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody></tbody></table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> xyz </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````

A "simpler" table, GFM style:

```````````````````````````````` example
abc | def
--- | ---
xyz | ghi
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>abc </th>
<th> def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>xyz </td>
<td> ghi</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````

We are making the parser slighly more lax here. Here is a table with spaces at
the end:

```````````````````````````````` example
Hello!

| _abc_ | セン |
| ----- | ---- |
| this row has a space at the end | | 
| But **_inline elements do_**. | x |

Hi!
.
<p>Hello!</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> <em>abc</em> </th>
<th> セン </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> this row has a space at the end </td>
<td> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> But <strong><em>inline elements do</em></strong>. </td>
<td> x </td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>Hi!</p>
````````````````````````````````

Table alignment:

```````````````````````````````` example
aaa | bbb | ccc | ddd | eee
:-- | --- | :-: | --- | --:
fff | ggg | hhh | iii | jjj
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">aaa </th>
<th> bbb </th>
<th align="center"> ccc </th>
<th> ddd </th>
<th align="right"> eee</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">fff </td>
<td> ggg </td>
<td align="center"> hhh </td>
<td> iii </td>
<td align="right"> jjj</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````

### Table cell count mismatches

The header and marker row must match.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b | c |
| --- | --- |
| this | isn't | okay |
.
<p>| a | b | c |
| --- | --- |
| this | isn't | okay |</p>
````````````````````````````````

But any of the body rows can be shorter. Rows longer
than the header are truncated.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b | c |
| --- | --- | ---
| x
| a | b
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> a </th>
<th> b </th>
<th> c </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> x</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> a </td>
<td> b</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 1 </td>
<td> 2 </td>
<td> 3 </td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````

### Embedded pipes

Tables with embedded pipes could be tricky.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b |
| --- | --- |
| Escaped pipes are \|okay\|. | Like \| this. |
| Within `|code| is okay` too. |
| **_`c|`_** \| complex
| don't **\_reparse\_**
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> a </th>
<th> b </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Escaped pipes are |okay|. </td>
<td> Like | this. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Within <code>|code| is okay</code> too. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <strong><em><code>c|</code></em></strong> | complex</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> don't <strong>_reparse_</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````

### Oddly-formatted markers

This shouldn't assert.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a |
--- |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> a </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````

### Escaping

```````````````````````````````` example
| a |
| --- |
| \\ |
| \\\\ |
| \_ |
| \| |
| \a |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> a </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> \ </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> \\ </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> _ </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> | </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> a </td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````

### Embedded HTML

```````````````````````````````` example
| a |
| --- |
| <strong>hello</strong> |
| ok <br> sure |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> a </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> <strong>hello</strong> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> ok <br> sure </td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````


## Strikethroughs

A well-formed strikethrough.

```````````````````````````````` example
A proper ~strikethrough~.
.
<p>A proper <del>strikethrough</del>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Some strikethrough edge cases.

```````````````````````````````` example
These are ~not strikethroughs.

No, they are not~

This ~is ~ legit~ isn't ~ legit.

This is just ~~~~~one~~~~~ huge strikethrough.
.
<p>These are ~not strikethroughs.</p>
<p>No, they are not~</p>
<p>This <del>is ~ legit</del> isn't ~ legit.</p>
<p>This is just <del>one</del> huge strikethrough.</p>
````````````````````````````````


## Autolinks

```````````````````````````````` example
: http://google.com https://google.com

<http://google.com/å> http://google.com/å

scyther@pokemon.com

www.github.com www.github.com/á

www.google.com/a_b

**Autolink and http://inlines**

![http://inline.com/image](http://inline.com/image)

a.w@b.c

Full stop outside parens shouldn't be included http://google.com/ok.

(Full stop inside parens shouldn't be included http://google.com/ok.)
.
<p>: <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a> <a href="https://google.com">https://google.com</a></p>

<p>(Full stop inside parens shouldn't be included <a href="http://google.com/ok">http://google.com/ok</a>.)</p>
````````````````````````````````


## Interop

Autolink and strikethrough.

```````````````````````````````` example
~~www.google.com~~

~~http://google.com~~
.
<p><del><a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a></del></p>
<p><del><a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a></del></p>
````````````````````````````````

Autolink and tables.

```````````````````````````````` example
| a | b |
| --- | --- |
| https://github.com www.github.com | http://pokemon.com |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> a </th>
<th> b </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> <a href="http://www.github.com">www.github.com</a> </td>
<td> <a href="http://pokemon.com">http://pokemon.com</a> </td>
</tr></tbody></table>
