## Tables

Here's a well-formed table, doing everything it should.

```````````````````````````````` example
| abc | def |
| --- | --- |
| ghi | jkl |
| mno | pqr |
.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> abc</th>
<th> def</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> ghi</td>
<td> jkl</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> mno</td>
<td> pqr</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````

We're going to mix up the table now; we'll demonstrate that inline formatting
works fine, but block elements don't.  You can also have empty cells, and the
textual alignment of the columns is shown to be irrelevant.

```````````````````````````````` example
Hello!

| _abc_ | セン |
| ----- | ---- |
| 1. Block elements inside cells don't work. | |
| But **_inline elements do_**. | x |

Hi!
.
<p>Hello!</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> <em>abc</em></th>
<th> セン</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 1. Block elements inside cells don't work.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> But <strong><em>inline elements do</em></strong>.</td>
<td> x</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>Hi!</p>
````````````````````````````````

Here we demonstrate some edge cases about what is and isn't a table.

```````````````````````````````` example
| Not enough table | to be considered table |

| Not enough table | to be considered table |
| Not enough table | to be considered table |

| Just enough table | to be considered table |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |

| ---- | --- |

| x |
| - |
.
<p>| Not enough table | to be considered table |</p>
<p>| Not enough table | to be considered table |
| Not enough table | to be considered table |</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Just enough table</th>
<th> to be considered table</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody></tbody></table>
<p>| ---- | --- |</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> x</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody></tbody></table>
````````````````````````````````


## Strikethroughs

A well-formed strikethrough.

```````````````````````````````` example
A proper ~strikethrough~.
.
<p>A proper <del>strikethrough</del>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Some strikethrough edge cases.

```````````````````````````````` example
These are ~not strikethroughs.

No, they are not~

This ~is ~ legit~ isn't ~ legit.
.
<p>These are ~not strikethroughs.</p>
<p>No, they are not~</p>
<p>This <del>is ~ legit</del> isn't ~ legit.</p>
